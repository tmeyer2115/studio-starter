      {
        "value": "Elliptical Sidecut – Elliptical Sidecut is made up of a longer radius underfoot and shorter radii in the tip and tail of the ski. The long radius underfoot means you can pivot faster and easier, while a shorter radius in the tip and tail result in easier turn initiation. This sidecut allows for a wide variety of turn lengths, angles and mounting positions."

        "value": "Directional Twin – A considerably skinnier tail width than in the tip provides ultimate downhill performance for attacking the mountain. A twin tip in the tail encourages playfulness and freestyle attitude, meaning you can ride switch with ease."

        "value": "Sustainable Poplar Wood Core – Poplar is a light-colored, medium-weight, durable softwood that flexes and pops nicely as well as having a whole load of vibration absorption capabilities. Used as the only wood in this core, it allows the ski to pop, butter and stomp like an all-mountain freestyle ski and also have enough torsional stability to grip impressively on the downhill."
      },
      {
        "value": "Microcap Full Strength Sidewall – Micro-cap construction is a hybrid of a premium, sandwich sidewall construction fused with a lightweight, durable cap construction. With micro-cap, the sandwich construction provides awesome edge hold and torsional stability while the ski’s topsheet wraps around and meets the sidewall, protecting the fragile joint that can be prone to chipping."
      },
      {
        "value": "XL 2.5mm Edges – Fractions of a millimeter might not sound like much, but when it comes to edges, it adds up. The 2.5mm edges stack an extra 25% of height on top of our already super-durable standard 2.0mm edges. This extra steel gives the rider a pair of skis that are going to take more abuse and last longer."

Clocking in at 98mm underfoot and with a do-it-all directional twin shape that outskis many purpose-built groomer skis but still spins and switches with the best, the Prodigy 2 makes anything possible, run after run after run.",
