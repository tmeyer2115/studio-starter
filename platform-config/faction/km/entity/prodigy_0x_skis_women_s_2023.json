        "value": "Elliptical Sidecut – Elliptical Sidecut is made up of a longer radius underfoot and shorter radii in the tip and tail of the ski. The long radius underfoot means you can pivot faster and easier, while a shorter radius in the tip and tail result in easier turn initiation. This sidecut allows for a wide variety of turn lengths, angles and mounting positions."

        "value": "Microcap Full Strength Sidewall – Micro-cap construction is a hybrid of a premium, sandwich sidewall construction fused with a lightweight, durable cap construction. With micro-cap, the sandwich construction provides awesome edge hold and torsional stability while the ski’s topsheet wraps around and meets the sidewall, protecting the fragile joint that can be prone to chipping."

The 2.5mm edges stack an extra 25% of height on top of our already super-durable standard 2.0mm edges. This extra steel gives the rider a pair of skis that are going to take more abuse and last longer."

    "description": "The Faction Prodigy 0X Skis (that\u0027s \"Zero-Ex\") are a light and nimble freeride ski perfect for younger and lighter skiers just getting into the freestyle ranks, who need a reliable tool for progression that\u0027s forgiving but dependable. An 85mm waisted design makes the 0X easier to coax into the turn and lighter than the other Prodigy models, but the basic design philosophy and rocker profile remain constant. Step it up with the 0X for straight up fun from day one.",
