    "description": "The best seller in the successful Kore lineup, the Head Kore 99 Skis are jacks-of-all-trades winners for skiers who consistently push their boundaries both inbounds and out. Super light, but with the trademarked Head straightline stability and excellent edgehold on firm surfaces, the Kore 99 is the perfect pick for a \"70/30\" ski - one that sees 70% of its use inbounds and 30% somewhere else (feel free to improvise here).",
