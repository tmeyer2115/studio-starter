    "description": "The Armada ARV 106 Skis are fun. They\u0027re fast, sturdy all-mountain twins that are designed to let you do whatever you want, whenever you want, without having to worry about the conditions or what skis you\u0027ve selected from your quiver for the day. They\u0027re quick edge to edge on groomer days, stable on landings and at speed, and have enough rocker and surface area to handle the deepest powder days. One thing that sets them apart from other all-mountain freestyle skis is Armada\u0027s Smear Tech that\u0027s featured in the tips and tails. This 3D beveling makes them surfier in the pow, butterier on the hard pack, and more fun to ride in almost any conditions.",
