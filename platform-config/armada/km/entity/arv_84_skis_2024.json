They\u0027re made with a lightweight, highly durable composite core, plus semi-cap sidewalls and oversized edges for maximum durability. They\u0027re soft and easy to press into a variety of turn shapes, which makes them perfect for mastering the art of the turn, or bashing against rails on your way to your first stomp.",
