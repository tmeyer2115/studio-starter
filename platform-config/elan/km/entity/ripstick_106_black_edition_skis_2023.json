        "value": "Amphibio Profile – The Amphibio profile is a revolutionary ski design that integrates both rocker and camber profiles into dedicated left and right skis. Amphibio skis feature a cambered inside edge assuring precision, edge grip, and stability while a rockered outside edge provides forgiveness, turning ease and smooth transitions."
      },
      {
        "value": "Tubelite Wood Core – To create the TubeLite Wood Core, two super lightweight Carbon tubes are inserted into a lightweight laminated wood core. Measuring 5mm in diameter and hollow in their construction, these tubes run along the length of the ski following the arc of the side cut. They provide torsional stability and powerful rebound while allowing for material reduction of the core. The result is incredible lightweight response and stability."
      },
      {
        "value": "Carbon Line Technology – Amphibio Carbon Line technology is a combination of innovations that provide the best balance of lightweight construction with power and performance. Amphibio Carbon Line technology elevates the asymmetrical ski design to the next level by strategically locating carbon reinforcement over the inside edges of the skis providing more power in the turn, while carbon rods inserted into the woodcore maximize weight savings and overall stability. The end result is an extremely lightweight high performance ski with uncompromised versatility and smooth performance."

These inserts reduce weight and vibration, dramatically improving stability and ensuring a smooth ride even in the most demanding conditions."

    "description": "Everybody knows what the Ripsticks do. They rip, of course. Elan\u0027s asymmetrical carbon-powered freeride sticks have gotten a lot of love for their unique combination of a relatively light weight and the ability to lay GS tracks down 50 degree faces with ease. And if that concept gets you a little excited, you\u0027re going to love the Elan Ripstick 106 Black Edition Skis. More than just a sick black topsheet, these beefed up Ripsticks have twice the number of carbon rods and full wall-to-wall reinforcement under the boot. That means you get more rip per stick than ever before, all while maintaining the nimble profile and versatile all mountain width that makes the Ripstick 106 so dang fun to ride.",
