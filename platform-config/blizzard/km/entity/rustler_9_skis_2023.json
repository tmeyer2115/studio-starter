    "description": "A funny thing happened in the winter of \u002721-22. Winter went dry for months in most of North America, and the wide ski powder maniacs were stuck for a low tide answer. A few of them got out on the Blizzard Rustler 9 Skis and were blown away. Who woulda thought, with that rocker line and limited edge contact, but here is ski that can rail with the best of the flat-tailed carvers and not punish the rider in bumps and re-frozen slop! The Titanal D.R.T. laminate does just what it was intended to do, namely smooth out the ride and make the ski feel uber-confident at speed, and the tail rocker means the Rustler doesn\u0027t lock in and take you for a ride. Do yourself a favor and check these out.",
