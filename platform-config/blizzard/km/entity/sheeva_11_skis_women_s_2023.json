They combine a unique silky ride with a level of control and precision seldom found on skis of this width — a product of their Titanal-infused D.R.T. construction and Blizzard\u0027s no-compromise attitude when it comes to edgehold and power. Look around you on a pow day, and you\u0027ll notice the preponderance of Sheeva 11\u0027s on the feet of the best skiers on the hill - this is the season to join the crowd.",
