    "description": "Looking for light, nimble, and secure all in one package? Bonus points if that package can be used as a hybrid lift-served/backcountry ski? Check out the Völkl Blaze 94 W Skis, \u0027cause we think you\u0027ll like what you see. At 1455 grams in a 165cm size, this is \"touring weight\", but it\u0027s no noodle - the Blaze 94 delivers typical precision Völkl turns and still rips on harder snow. A prime contender to mount with a hybrid binding and be ready for anything, even if there\u0027s no lift.",
