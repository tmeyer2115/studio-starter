        "value": "3D Radius Sidecut – Three radii in one ski shape deliver maximum versatility - long radii at the tip and tail for stability and smoothness, and a short radius in the mid-body allows the skier to switch from long arcs to short turns at will, at any speed."

        "value": "Tailored Titanal Frame – The size of the frames is tailored to the skier\u0027s height, skiing ability and power. This means that longer ski models have a higher titanal content for more stiffness, more direct power transmission and stronger dampening. The shorter the length, the lower the titanal content, which makes the ski more agile, so that smaller, lighter and less powerful skiers can use the full potential performance of the ski."

        "value": "Tailored Carbon Tips – In this innovative manufacturing process the new Tailored Carbon Tips are produced by embroidering the individual carbon fibers onto a carrier material. This allows them to be positioned exactly along the stress lines, opening up completely new possibilities, for performance at the front of the ski, which has a decisive influence on handling."

    "description": "We\u0027re not sure why they keep using this name, because the word\u0027s out. The Völkl Secret 96 Skis are the ripper skier\u0027s best friend, and the closest thing to a race ski that\u0027ll easily handle every snow condition on the mountain. The previous version of this ski was no slouch, but with the addition of the Tailored Titanal tip and Tailored Carbon Tips the Secret becomes calmer and more manageable without losing any of its inner strength or ability to track cleanly at speed. An amazing ski that responds best to a confident driver, the Secret 96 belongs in your quiver even if it\u0027s a quiver of one.",
