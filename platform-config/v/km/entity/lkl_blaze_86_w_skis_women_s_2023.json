Light and very stable poplar and beech woods, individually weighed and selected by weight before gluing, are used in this wood core. In the tip-to-tail construction, the wood extends to the tip of the blade and end, giving them the sophisticated combination of good stability and low weight. In the center of the core, a CNC-milled Isocore area contributes to optimal liveliness and dynamic development. All in all, this design allows the stability of the ski to meet the high demands of a freeride ski, and this at a weight that is only slightly higher than that of a touring ski."

Yes, it is possible to get all of that in one ski, and Völkl\u0027s decades of experience makes the difference. A Multilayer Woodcore Light construction with 3D Radius Sidecut and full sidewalls contribute to make this one of the most versatile and dependable light skis out there.",
