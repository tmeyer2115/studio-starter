        "value": "3D Radius Sidecut – Three radii in one ski shape deliver maximum versatility - long radii at the tip and tail for stability and smoothness, and a short radius in the mid-body allows the skier to switch from long arcs to short turns at will, at any speed."

        "value": "Hybrid Multilayer Woodcore – The extra-light hybrid multilayer wood core is a very complex core that is used in the Blaze. Light and very stable poplar and beech woods, individually weighed and selected by weight before gluing, are used in this wood core. In the tip-to-tail construction, the wood extends to the tip of the blade and end, giving them the sophisticated combination of good stability and low weight. In the center of the core, a CNC-milled Isocore area contributes to optimal liveliness and dynamic development. All in all, this design allows the stability of the ski to meet the high demands of a freeride ski, and this at a weight that is only slightly higher than that of a touring ski."

        "value": "Suspension Tips and Tails – Inserts made of elastic TPU material on the edges of the tip and tail which act like a bumper in wind-blown or tracked snow. Its shock-absorbing elasticity ensures better stability and catch-free float."

    "description": "Lightweight alpine ski that\u0027s quick and nimble enough for tight trees and technical terrain? Touring ski with enough guts to ski with confidence in tough terrain and variable snow? The Völkl Blaze 94 Skis are both. Amazingly stable and confident for their light weight, experienced backcountry skiers as well as inbounds riders who prefer their sticks on the light and maneuverable side are both finding the Blaze 94 hits a sweet spot they\u0027d never known existed. A full sidewall construction with just a bit of Titanal underfoot and Völkl\u0027s proven 3D Radius add up to a package that\u0027s yearning to turn and capable anywhere on the mountain.",
